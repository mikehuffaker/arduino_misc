This repository contains misc sketch code to drive an Arduino micro-controller
board.  These are all just test sketches.  I'm sharing them as open source, in
case anyone is interested, however be advised that none of these sketches will
 work unless you have the arduino wired up correctly with the correct supporting
electronic components.  

Also note that although I am sharing this code as Open Source, please 
respect the BSD license terms, as stated in the LICENSE.txt file.

joytest_GD_nunchuck - test program to test Nunchuck Wii control arduino library
I coded.  Requires Arduino connected to Wii Nunchuck and GameDuino sheild. 
Wii can be used to move cursor object ( a sprite ) around the screen and the
 x/y values will also be displayed.

sketch_light_strip_test - earlier version of the holiday lights project I used
when testing with WS2801 LED light strips.

sketch_nunchuck_test - simple test program for reading a Wii nunchuck connected
to an Arduino and printing values to the test console over a serial port.
