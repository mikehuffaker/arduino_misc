This repository contains misc sketch code to drive an Arduino micro-controller
board.  These are all just test sketches.  I'm sharing them as open source, in
case anyone is interested, however be advised that none of these sketches will
 work unless you have the arduino wired up correctly and the code is test code 
and is provided "AS-IS".

Also note that although I am sharing this code as Open Source, please 
respect the BSD license terms, as stated in the LICENSE.txt file.
